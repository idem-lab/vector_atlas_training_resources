# Training resources hub [IN DEVELOPMENT]

This repository contains linkages to a curated set of **free** online resources for self-directed and mentored learning on data management, visualisation, basic spatial analysis and presentation, and modelling of mosquito disease vectors, tailored to collaborators of the **Vector Atlas**.

The repository is roughly in order from introductory to more advanced, and the though each item is not necessarily a prerequisite for those that follow.  

We have three broad areas of resources:

- [Data Management, Manipulation, and Presentation in R](# data-management,-manipulation,-and-presentation-in-R)
- [Working with Spatial Data](#Working with Spatial Data)
- [Species Distribution Modelling](#Species Distribution Modelling)  
  
  
## Data Management, Manipulation, and Presentation in R

### Introductory R resources
  
We recommend R as a tool for the analysis of data. It is free, widely used, has many learning and support resources available, and can be very powerful. R is a programming-language based tool that does require a degree of up-front investment of time in learning to produce results and comfortably use the tool. For people who regularly want to manipulate or analyse data, and produce graphics, we suggest that this may be a worthwhile investment. We also produce R-based resources and through our work in the Vector Atlas that can be easily reused and repurposed toward collaborators' specific needs.  

#### A Gentle Introduction to Tidy Statistics in R
*Thomas Mock* <https://posit.co/resources/videos/a-gentle-introduction-to-tidy-statistics-in-r/>

This is a great starting point for learning about R. 1--hour video introduction to why and how you might do data analyses in R, and to how the whole system works (R, RStudio, packages). This is *not* an introduction to statistics, but an introduction to how to do some things in R. The slides are available on a linked github page - look for the pdf on that link. There is also a (slightly older) [blog version of the video here](https://themockup.netlify.app/posts/2018-12-10-a-gentle-guide-to-tidy-statistics-in-r/).  
*We strongly recommend to setting the video quality to the highest available so that you can clearly see the code in the video. This can be done by clicking the settings cog in the bottom-right of the video panel, and selecting Quality to 1080p.*  
  

#### Getting Started with Data in R
*Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim* <https://moderndive.netlify.app/1-getting-started.html>

Step-by-step written introduction to getting started using R. This takes you through installing R and RStudio, some introductory concepts. Page is the first part of a longer [ebook that is also freely available](https://moderndive.netlify.app) and will walk you through further stages of learning to use R to produce graphs and basic statistical analyses. 
  


#### RStudio Education
<https://education.rstudio.com>

A series of links to educational resources curated by RStudio --- from beginner, to intermediate, to more advanced topics.  
  

### Further R learning

#### R for data science (2<sup>nd</sup> edition)
*Hadley Wickham* <https://r4ds.hadley.nz>

This free ebook is a comprehensive guide to developing modern data science skills in R. It covers a wide range of methods for dealing with data --- reading, writing, transforming, manipulating, and visualising. It does not teach modelling, but it does teach a range of foundational skills needed to get data into and out of models. This text also covers the `tidyverse` paackage, which is a ubiquitous group of R packages that have a consistent style of programming that is different from basic R, but widely considered more user-friendly.  
  

#### R Programming
*Roger D. Peng* <https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming>

This is a popular R introductory to intermediate course and is free on Coursera from Johns Hopkins University. The course is a comprehensive foundation in fundamentals of base-R, but is a large commitment in time to complete and does not cover a number of modern areas of R-programming like `tidyverse`.  
  

#### Advanced R (2<sup>nd</sup> edition)
*Hadley Wickham* <https://adv-r.hadley.nz>

This book is for users of R ready to advance toward and beyond an intermediate level, through a deeper understanding of the functioning of the R language, and advanced functional programming and beyond. 

### Data presentation

#### Data Visualization: A practical introduction
*Kieran Healy* <https://socviz.co/>

An excellent transition from the very basics of making your first plots in R, through to advanced consideration of how to and why to use plots do best communicate your data, to advanced methods for tuning graphics.
