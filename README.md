# Training resources hub [IN DEVELOPMENT]

This repository contains linkages to a curated set of free online resources for self-directed and mentored learning on data management, visualisation, basic spatial analysis and presentation, and modelling of mosquito disease vectors, tailored to collaborators of the **Vector Atlas**.  

The repository is roughly in order from introductory to more advanced, and the though each item is not necessarily a prerequisite for those that follow.

## Data management, manipulation, and presentation in R

#### Introductory R resources

https://posit.co/resources/videos/a-gentle-introduction-to-tidy-statistics-in-r/

https://moderndive.netlify.app/1-getting-started.html

https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/

#### R Programming
*Roger D. Peng*

[https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming)

This is a popular R introductory course and is free on Coursera from Johns Hopkins University. The course is a comprehensive foundation in fundamentals of base-R, but is a large commitment in time to complete and does not cover a number of modern areas of R-programming like `tidyverse`.


## Spatial data manipulation

#### Spatial data with `terra`

### 


## Species distribution modelling 


####  Species distribution modelling 
*Robert Hijmans and Jane Elith*

[https://rspatial.org/sdm/index.html](https://rspatial.org/sdm/index.html)


#### Species distriubtion modelling for vectors course
*Nick Golding and Gerry Ryan*
